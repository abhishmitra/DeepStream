DeepStream
==========

This is the project for the wesbsite pacebyte.com.

It is essentially an aggregator service, that creates wikipedia like articles without the involvement of editors.
The information is taken from websites with relavent content (credit is duely given).

It is reliant on Bing's Search API that provides links for a search term. 

NOTE:
 The website is currently not functioning right. I have been quite busy recently, and so i haven't gotten the time to 
 review the problems. 
 I'll get to it when possible.
